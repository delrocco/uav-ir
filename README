Compiling
----------------------------------------
In general, follow the README.md files in each c/c++ program folder.

1) build "libs" with make
2) build "capture" with make
3) build "video" with qmake-qt4 && make

With Fedora on Raspberry Pi 2 and Raspian on Raspberry Pi 3, I had to use sudo to run these programs.

Getting this setup is pretty straightforward.
The only real problem I had is the "red square of death" with video program, that occurs when it is started. There is much discussion on the Internet, and why this occurs. Some believe it is some kind of synchronization issue at startup. Others say the wiring diagram is incorrect. The only fix I found that worked reliably, was moving the CS wire from pin 26 to pin 24.

Scripts
----------------------------------------
All Python scripts were written in Python 2.7, and display help options with -h.
Most of the bash shell scripts require arguments to be passed in.

upload.sh and autocapture.sh expect the capture program and resulting frames directory
to be relative to them in the same directory tree as this repo.

framestrip.py examples:
framestrip.py -h
framestrip.py -r 0.5 -s 1980x-1 -o jpg  ~/Desktop/OrlandoScienceCenter/RGB/DJI00220.MP4

processir.sh examples:
processir.sh ~/Desktop/OrlandoScienceCenter/IR/ png 800x600
processir.sh ~/Desktop/OrlandoScienceCenter/IR/ tiff 1024x768

pgmhelper.py examples:
pgmhelper.py ~/Desktop/frames/ -b
pgmhelper.py ~/Desktop/frames/ -b | xargs rm
pgmhelper.py ~/Desktop/frames/ -r
pgmhelper.py ~/Desktop/frames/original/ -o ~/Desktop/frames/scaled/ -s 1523-3122

visualize.sh examples:
visualize.sh ~/Desktop/frames/ ~/Desktop/frames/visible jpg 1024x768

colorize.sh examples:
